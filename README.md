📟 Calculator App (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

This project is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created it to practice front-end fundamentals and better understand how structure, styling, and functionality work together in a small web application.

💡 What I Learned

IDs vs Classes

Used IDs for elements that needed to be accessed directly and uniquely in JavaScript, such as the calculator display.

Used classes for groups of similar elements like number buttons and operators, allowing for reusable styling and shared behavior.

This helped me understand when to use IDs for single elements and classes for repeated elements.

Basic DOM Manipulation

Selected elements using getElementById and querySelectorAll

Updated the display dynamically based on user input

Event Handling

Added click event listeners to buttons

Connected button clicks to calculator actions

JavaScript Logic

Handled user input and basic arithmetic operations

Managed simple application state during calculations

✨ Features

Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

Clear and responsive button layout

Real-time display updates

Clean and simple user interface

🚀 Future Improvements

Add keyboard support for number and operator input

Improve error handling (such as division by zero)

Enhance styling and responsiveness for mobile devices

Refactor JavaScript for better readability and scalability

🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project was to build confidence working with vanilla JavaScript, improve my understanding of front-end basics, and gain hands-on experience building a functional interactive application.
